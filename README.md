# DSA Practice (C++)

This repository contains curated Data Structures and Algorithms solutions
implemented in C++ for interview preparation.

The focus is on **pattern-based problem solving**, clean code, and clear explanations.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen DSA fundamentals
- Master common interview patterns
- Write clean, readable, and optimized C++ solutions
- Build a long-term reference for revision

## 🧠 Approach
- Problems are organized by **problem-solving patterns**, not by difficulty.
- Each solution includes:
  - Key idea / pattern
  - Time and space complexity
  - Clean and readable code
